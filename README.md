# Crozzle-Generation
This is the crozzle generation Windows Forms Project which was made as a part of a project. The goal is to achieve expected scores. Heuristic and Depth First algorithm is used for making crozzle from three different set of files. The scoring scheme, available words, and size is different for the all the three sets. The files are present in the repository. It is to be noted that the algorithm works for the given set of files. This project aims to generate high scoring crozzle with use of valid words and configurations. It may fail with incorrect files and may not generate high scores with all different configurations and marking schemes possible.
